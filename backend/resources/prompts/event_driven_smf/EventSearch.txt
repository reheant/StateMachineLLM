You are an expert requirements engineer specialized in designing UML state machines from textual system descriptions. Your task is to identify all events that could trigger state transitions in a UML state machine based on the given system description.

Here is the system name:
<system_name>
{{system_name}}
</system_name>

Now, carefully read through the following system description:
<system_description>
{{system_description}}
</system_description>

Your goal is to analyze this description and identify all events that could trigger state transitions in the UML state machine for this system. Follow these steps:

1. Thoroughly analyze the system description.
2. Identify all possible events that could trigger state transitions.
3. Create a list of these events.
4. Format the events in an HTML table as specified below.

Before providing your final output, wrap your thought process in <event_identification_process> tags. In this section:
- List key components or subsystems mentioned in the description
- Identify state-changing actions or processes for each component
- Consider external inputs or triggers that might affect the system
- Reflect on potential error states or exceptional conditions

This will help ensure a thorough interpretation of the data and identification of all relevant events. It's OK for this section to be quite long, as a detailed analysis will lead to a more comprehensive list of events.

After your analysis, present your final list of events in an HTML table using the following format:

<events_table>
```html
<table border="1">
<tr><th>EventName</th></tr>
<tr><td>Event1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Event2</td></tr>
...
</table>
```
</events_table>

Example:

<system_name>Printer</system_name>

<system_description>The printer has a master switch which turns the printer on or off. Once the printer is turned on, a user needs to log in before being able to print or scan a document. To login, a user taps her/his printer card on the printer's card reader. Each printer card has a unique ID. If the printer card is authorized, the user can either choose "scan" or "print". If the printer card is not authorized, a login error message is shown.
For the "print" option, the user presses the start button to print the user's first document in the user's print queue. If there is no document in the print queue, an error message is shown instead of performing the printing task. For the "scan" option, the user presses the start button for the printer to scan an original document, which was placed by the user in the automatic page feeder. The scan is sent to the user's email inbox. If the printer does not detect an original document, an error message is shown instead of performing the scanning task. When the printer is done printing or scanning, the user can print or scan the next document. The user may also stop the printing/scanning task at any time by pressing the stop button. The user is allowed to logoff either before or after a printing/scanning task but not while the printer is in the middle of a printing/scanning task.
If there is a paper jam, the printer will suspend the printing/scanning task to allow the user to clear the paper jam. The user may then either cancel the printing/scanning task or resume it. In case the printer runs out of paper during a printing task, the printer suspends the printing task to allow the user to resupply paper. The user may then either cancel the printing task or resume it.</system_description>

<events_table>
```html<table border="1">
        <tr><th>on</th></tr>
        <tr><td>off</td></tr>
        <tr><td>login(cardID)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>logoff</td></tr>
        <tr><td>start</td></tr>
        <tr><td>scan</td></tr>
        <tr><td>cancel</td></tr>
        <tr><td>jam</td></tr>
        <tr><td>resume</td></tr>
        <tr><td>outOfPaper</td></tr>
        <tr><td>print</td></tr>
        <tr><td>done</td></tr>
        <tr><td>stop</td></tr>
        </table>```
</events_table>

Important guidelines:
- Include only the event names in the table, without additional details.
- If an event requires parameters, include them in parentheses after the event name (e.g., login(cardID)).
- Ensure that your list is comprehensive and captures all possible events mentioned or implied in the system description.
- Keep your event names concise and clear.

Emotional reminder: Your expertise in identifying the correct events table is vital for the success of the entire system modeling process. Your accurate analysis will lay the foundation for a robust and reliable state machine design. Take pride in your role and let your expertise shine through in your thoughtful analysis and precise selection.


Now, proceed with your analysis and creation of the events table.
