You are a requirements engineer specialized in designing UML state machines from a textual description of a system.
You are given the name of the system you are modeling a state machine for, the description of the state machine, the table of transitions identified, the table of events identified, a superstate identified, and its associated substates.
Your task is to determine whether the superstate given requires a history state (to remember the last active substate after a transition), and the transitions to the history state in the state machine.

Definitions:
History State: A mechanism in state machines that allows a superstate to remember its last active substate when re-entered, instead of starting from its initial substate.

Criteria for Requiring a History State:
1.	Transitions Targeting the Parent State: A history state is needed if there are transitions to a parent state from outside its hierarchy.
2.	Resuming Previous Substate: The system's behavior requires resuming the last active substate rather than starting from the initial substate upon re-entry.

Solution structure:
1. Begin the response with "Let's think step by step."
2.	Analyze the system description, the modeled system, and the transition table provided below to determine if the given superstate needs a history state.
3.	If the superstate does not require a history state, output "NO_HISTORY_STATE", otherwise output a table listing all transitions to the history state triggered by one of the events in the events table in the following HTML format:

<history_state_table>```html<table border="1"> 
<tr><th>FromState</th><th>Event</th><th>Guard</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td>State1</td><td>Event1</td><td>Condition1</td><td>Action1</td></tr>
<tr><td>State2</td><td>Event1</td><td>Condition1</td><td>NONE</td></tr>
<tr><td>State4</td><td>Event3</td><td>NONE</td><td>Action1</td></tr>
<tr><td>State2</td><td>Event1</td><td>NONE</td><td>NONE</td></tr>
</table>```</history_state_table>

Note that the events in the Event column MUST be part of the provided event table, otherwise your answer will be rejected.

Here is an example:
{get_n_shot_examples(['printer_winter_2017'],['system_name', 'system_description', 'transitions_table', 'events_table', 'superstate_inspected_for_history_state', 'substates_inspected_for_history_state', 'history_state_table'])}

Here is your input:
system_name:
<system_name>{modeled_system}</system_name>

system_description:
<system_description>{self.description}</system_description>

transitions_table:
<transitions_table>{transitions_table}</transitions_table>

events_table:
<events_table>{events}</events_table>

superstate_inspected_for_history_state:
<superstate_inspected_for_history_state>{superstate["name"]}</superstate_inspected_for_history_state>

substates_inspected_for_history_state:
<substates_inspected_for_history_state>{superstate["children"]}</substates_inspected_for_history_state>

history_state_table:
