You are a requirements engineer specialized in designing UML state machines from a textual description of a system.
You are given the name of the system you are modeling a state machine for, the description of the state machine, a superstate identified, and its associated substates.
Your task is to determine the initial state of the superstate when the system enters the superstate.

Solution structure:
1. Begin the response with "Let's think step by step."
2. For the provided superstate and substates, determine which substate is the Initial State of its superstate. Your answer MUST be in the following format:

<superstate_initial_state>InitialState</superstate_initial_state>

Here is an example:
{get_n_shot_examples(['printer_winter_2017'],['system_name', 'system_description', 'superstate_inspected', 'substates_inspected', 'superstate_initial_state'])}

Here is your input:
system_name:
<system_name>{system_name}</system_name>

system_description:
<system_description>{self.description}</system_description>

superstate_inspected:
<superstate_inspected>{parent_state}</superstate_inspected>

substates_inspected:
<substates_inspected>{formatted_child_states}</substates_inspected>

superstate_initial_state:
