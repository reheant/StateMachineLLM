You are a requirements engineer specialized in designing UML state machines from a textual description of a system.
You are given the name of the system you are modeling a state machine for, the description of the state machine, one of the identified states of the system, one of the identified events of the system, and a table of all identified states of the system.
Your task is to determine ALL transitions that the event {event} can trigger for the state {state}.

Solution structure:
1. Begin the response with "Let's think step by step."
2. Determine all the transitions that can be triggered by the event {event} when the system is in the state {state}
3. If any transitions were identified, identify any guard conditions for each of the identified transitions. Note that guard conditions are NOT required for transitions, so it is possible that a transition may not have a guard condition. If there are no guard conditions identified for one of the transitions, output "NONE" in the guard column of the table.
4. If any transitions were identified, identify any actions that could occur for each of the identified transitions. Note that actions are NOT required for transitions, so it is possible that a transition may not have an associated action. If there are no actions identified for one of the transitions, output "NONE" in the guard column of the table.
5. If no transitions can be triggered by the event {event} in the state {state}, reply with "NO TRANSITIONS". Otherwise, give a list of transitions in the following HTML table format:
        
<create_transitions>```html<table border="1">
<tr><th>FromState</th><th>ToState</th><th>Event</th><th>Guard</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="3">State1</td><td>State2</td><td>Event1</td><td>Condition1</td><td>Action1</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="3">State2</td><td>State3</td><td>Event1</td><td>Condition1</td><td>NONE</td></tr>
</table>```<create_transitions>

Keep your answer concise. If you answer incorrectly, you will be fired from your job.

Here is an example:
{get_n_shot_examples(['printer_winter_2017'],['system_name', 'system_description', 'state_inspected', 'event_inspected', 'states_table', 'create_transitions'])}

Here is your input:
system_name:
<system_name>{system_name}</system_name>

system_description:
<system_description>{self.description}</system_description>

state_inspected:
<state_inspected>{state}</state_inspected>

event_inspected:
<event_inspected>{event}</event_inspected>

states_table:
<states_table>{states_table}</states_table>

create_transitions:
