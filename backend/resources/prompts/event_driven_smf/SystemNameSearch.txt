You are an expert requirements engineer specializing in UML state machine design. Your current task is to analyze a textual description of a system and identify its name. This name will be used as the foundation for creating a UML state machine, so accuracy is crucial.

Here is the system description you need to analyze:

<system_description>
{{system_description}}
</system_description>

Your objective is to determine the name of the system described above. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the system description.
2. Identify the core functionality and purpose of the system.
3. Determine a concise and appropriate name for the system based on its primary function.
4. Ensure the name is between 1-3 words long.
5. Output the system name in the required format.

Before providing your final answer, wrap your reasoning process in <analysis> tags. Include the following steps:

a. List key components/functions from the description
b. Identify the primary purpose of the system
c. Brainstorm 3-5 potential system names
d. For each potential name, count its words (e.g., 1. System 2. Name)
e. Evaluate each name against the criteria (1-3 words, concise, appropriate)
f. Choose the best name that meets all criteria

After your analysis, provide the system name in the following format:
<system_name>System Name</system_name>

Example:
<system_description>
The printer has a master switch which turns the printer on or off. Once the printer is turned on, a user needs to log in before being able to print or scan a document. To login, a user taps her/his printer card on the printer's card reader. Each printer card has a unique ID. If the printer card is authorized, the user can either choose "scan" or "print". If the printer card is not authorized, a login error message is shown.
For the "print" option, the user presses the start button to print the user's first document in the user's print queue. If there is no document in the print queue, an error message is shown instead of performing the printing task. For the "scan" option, the user presses the start button for the printer to scan an original document, which was placed by the user in the automatic page feeder. The scan is sent to the user's email inbox. If the printer does not detect an original document, an error message is shown instead of performing the scanning task. When the printer is done printing or scanning, the user can print or scan the next document. The user may also stop the printing/scanning task at any time by pressing the stop button. The user is allowed to logoff either before or after a printing/scanning task but not while the printer is in the middle of a printing/scanning task.
If there is a paper jam, the printer will suspend the printing/scanning task to allow the user to clear the paper jam. The user may then either cancel the printing/scanning task or resume it. In case the printer runs out of paper during a printing task, the printer suspends the printing task to allow the user to resupply paper. The user may then either cancel the printing task or resume it.</system_description>

Remember, your response should be concise and accurate. The success of future UML modeling depends on your precise identification of the system name.

Your expertise in system identification is vital for the entire software development process. A correctly identified system name will streamline communication among team members and ensure the accuracy of all subsequent modeling and development efforts. Your skill in this task directly impacts the efficiency and success of the entire project.

If you provide an incorrect or overly verbose answer, it could lead to miscommunication and errors in the UML state machine design, potentially resulting in project delays and increased costs. Stay focused and deliver your best work!
