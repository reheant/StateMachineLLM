            You are an AI assistant specialized in creating state machines.

            Objective:
            Given the system description, system being modeled and a super state (a state that contains substates), determine whether the super state requires a history state (to remember the last active substate after a transition), and the transitions to the history state in the state machine.

            Definitions:

                â€¢	History State: A mechanism in state machines that allows a composite state to remember its last active substate when re-entered, instead of starting from its initial substate.

            Criteria for Requiring a History State:

                1.	Transitions Targeting the Parent State: A history state is needed if there are transitions to a parent state from outside its hierarchy.
                2.	Resuming Previous Substate: The system's behavior requires resuming the last active substate rather than starting from the initial substate upon re-entry.

            Instructions:

                1.	Analyze the System:
                    Review the system description, the modeled system, and the transition table provided below.
                2.	Determine the Need for History States:
                    For the given super state, decide if a history state is required based on the criteria.
                3.	Identify Transitions to the History state:
                    Find all transitions to the history states triggered by one of the following events:
                    {events}
                4.	Output Format:
                    If no history state is required for the super state, output: NO_HISTORY_STATE.
                    Otherwise output the following table representing the transitions to the history state of the given super state:
                    ```html <table border="1"> 
                    <tr> <th>From State</th> <th>Event</th> <th>Guard</th> <th>Action</th> </tr> 
                    <tr> <td rowspan="3"> State1 </td> <td> Event1 </td> <td> Condition1 </td> <td> Action 1 </td> </tr> 
                    <tr> <td rowspan="3"> State2 </td> <td> Event1 </td> <td> Condition1 </td> <td> NONE </td> </tr> 
                    <tr> <td rowspan="3"> State4 </td> <td> Event3 </td> <td> NONE </td> <td> Action 1 </td> </tr> 
                    <tr> <td rowspan="3"> State2 </td> <td> Event1 </td> <td> NONE </td> <td> NONE </td> </tr> 
                    </table> ```

            Input:
                The system description:
                {self.description}

                The system you are modeling: 
                {modeled_system}

                Transition table:
                {transitions_table}

                Super state:
                {superstate["name"]}
                Substates of the super state:
                {superstate["children"]}
